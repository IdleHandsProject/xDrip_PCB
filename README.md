# xDrip_PCB
A custom PCB for the xDrip Project
The xDrip project can be found here: http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/
Note: This board has not been tested. It is a WIP.
Please don't go blindly ordering a board and expecting it to work. Go over the schematics yourself and confirm everything is correct. I will post an update when I have a working version.
I am also working on a 3D printed case that will be available on shapeways, and I will be looking into mass producing the boards to reduce the costs.
I post updates on Twitter: @idlehandsdev
