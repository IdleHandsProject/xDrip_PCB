# xDrip_PCB

A custom PCB for the xDrip Project
<p>The xDrip project can be found here: http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/
Note: This board has not been tested. It is a WIP.
<p>Please don't go blindly ordering a board and expecting it to work. Go over the schematics yourself and confirm everything is correct. I will post an update when I have a working version.
<p>I am also working on a 3D printed case that will be available on shapeways, and I will be looking into mass producing the boards to reduce the costs. They will be fully completed boards.
